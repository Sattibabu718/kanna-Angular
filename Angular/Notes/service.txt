Services are used to store common data and to provide communication between any components.
you can create a service by command 
" ng generate service service-name"
it will create two file i.e., one ts and one .spec.ts files and spec.ts is used for testing and actual service lies in .ts

services are initialized with @Injectable decorator stating that these services can be injectable into any other services

How to use Service:
 -- import service in any components
 -- create an instance for that service in constructor parameter of that component


Dependency Injection: it is one of the fundamental concept in angular.By creating instance in the constructor parameter angular makes the component/pipes/directive independent from its dependencies

HTTP CLIENT:
httpClient in angular is used to handle http requests

httpClient returns observable similarly as fetch returns promises
observable means multiple asynchronous functions
